    <h3><span>Virtual Cursor Gesticulation by Hand Gestures and Speech Interaction</span></h3>
    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>Our project's main objective is to revolutionize the way we interect with computers by introducing a virtual cursor controlled solely through hand gestures and speech recognition.<br>This advanced system is designed to smoothly perform all mouse and keyboard functions,eliminating the requirement for extra hardware. By utilizing just a webcam and a microphone,<br>our virtual cursor surpasses the limitations of conventional input devices, making computer interaction more intuitive and accessible. It simply redifines the traditional mouse and <br>keyboard usage through hand gestures and voice commands.</p>
    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>Our project "Virtual Cursor Gesticulation by Hand Gestures and Speech Interaction" redifines traditional mouse usage by combining computer vision for hand gestures and speech recognition. <br>Using intuitive hand movements, users can perform actions like clicking and scrolling. Additionally,speech commands offer a hands-free alternative for seamless interaction.<br>While traditional input devices have limitations,our goal is not only to overcome these challenges but also to provide users with a more intuitive and efficient means of interaction.<br>By introducing speech recognition into the mix,we extend the possibilities,allowing users to control their screens through both gestures and voice commands,<br>creating a versatile and user-friendly interface. </p>
